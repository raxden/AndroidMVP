Android MVP
===========

Android MVP is a base library to work with [Model-View-Presenter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93presenter) pattern. Works on Android 4.1 (API level 16) and upwards.

A lot of Android applications use only the Model-View architecture. Using this approach, we can quickly develop new features. We use Activity or Fragment as an object that implements logic, handles UI, and controls the flow between data objects and UI. One typical scenario for creating a new screen entails creating a new Activity class, adding a bunch of views, some AsyncTasks for background operations, tracking the state of Activity… before realizing that we’ve ended up with complex code where everything is connected to everything.

### The presenter
The presenter is responsible to act as the middle man between view and model. It retrieves data from the model and returns it formatted to the view. But unlike the typical MVC, it also decides what happens when you interact with the view.
### The View
The view, usually implemented by an Activity (it may be a Fragment, a View… depending on how the app is structured), will contain a reference to the presenter. The only thing that the view will do is calling a method from the presenter every time there is an interface action (a button click for example).
### The model
In an application with a good layered architecture, this model would only be the gateway to the domain layer or business logic. If we were using the Uncle Bob clean architecture , the model would probably be an interactor that implements a use case.



## Usage

### Fragment like view

**1. Create your view interface that cointains the view behaviour**

 ```java
public interface MainFragmentView {
    void onLoading(String loadingMessage);
    void onFinishLoading();
    void onLoadingError(String title, String message);
    void userLogged();
}
```

**2. Create your presenter interface that cointains the presenter behaviour **
**3. Create your presenter implementation interface that cointains the presenter behaviour **
**1. Extends from MVPActivity<YourPresenter>**
**1. Implements your view**
**1. Gradle dependency**

 ```xml
 
 
 
```

In order to use the library, there are 3 options:

**1. Gradle dependency**

 - 	Add the following to your `build.gradle`:
 ```gradle
repositories {
	    maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
}

dependencies {
	    compile 'com.github.raxden:AndroidMVP:3.0.2@aar'
}
```

**2. Maven**
- Add the following to your `pom.xml`:
 ```xml
<repository>
       	<id>jitpack.io</id>
	    <url>https://jitpack.io</url>
</repository>

<dependency>
	    <groupId>com.github.raxden</groupId>
	    <artifactId>AndroidMVP</artifactId>
	    <version>3.0.2</version>
</dependency>
```

**3. clone whole repository**
 - Open your **commandline-input** and navigate to your desired destination folder (where you want to put the library)
 - Use the command `git clone https://github.com/raxden/AndroidMVP.git` to download the full AndroidMVP repository to your computer (this includes the folder of the library project as well as the example project)
